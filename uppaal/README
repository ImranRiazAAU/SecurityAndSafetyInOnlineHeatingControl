1. Introduction
===============

This is a development snapshot 4.1.20 of UPPAAL Stratego -- a model checker
which combines the previous technologies and adds explicit strategy support.
The tool combines:
* Symbolic analysis (Uppaal zone based exploration),
* Statistical model-checking (Uppaal SMC),
* Timed games (Uppaal TIGA)
* Strategy refinemnent via learning.
* Strategy evaluation via SMC.
* Rare event probability estimate via "Reach" and "Rare" queries.

Note that UPPAAL is free for non-profit applications but we want all
users to fill in a license agreement. This can be done online on the
web site http://www.uppaal.org/ or by sending in the form attached
below.

This product includes software developed by the Apache Software
Foundation (http://www.apache.org/).

2. Installation
===============

To install, unzip the zip-file uppaal-stratego-4.1.20.zip. This should create
the directory uppaal-stratego-4.1.20 containing at least the files uppaal,
uppaal.jar, and the directories lib, bin-Linux, bin-Win32, lib, and demo.
The bin-directories should all contain the two
files verifyta(.exe) and server(.exe) plus some additional files,
depending on the platform. The demo-directory should contain some
demo files with suffixes .xml and .q.

Note that UPPAAL graphical interface requires Oracle Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) at least version 6 installed on the host system.
Java can be downloaded from http://java.oracle.com/ .

To run UPPAAL on Linux systems run the uppaal script.
To run on Windows systems double click the file uppaal.jar.
To install launching shortcuts: run AddLinks{.vbs,.sh} script.

3. New features and changes since 4.1.19
=======================================
* Integrated TIGA queries
* Added strategy referencing to the TIGA queries in Verifier
* Added SMC query evaluation under a given strategy.

4. Known issues is this release
===============================

1. The symbolic simulator ("Simulator" tab in the GUI) may crash
   -- this is to be fixed for official release.
   Please use the concrete simulator ("ConcreteSimulator" tab) instead.
